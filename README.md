# Data-Analytics-Projects
This Repository contains Data Analysis Projects.
Medical Project and Supermarket Retail sales analysis are notebooks and Fc Project is freecodecamp projects.

While doing this projects I perform processes like read data from different sources, data cleaning, wrangling, use statistical methods. Find correlations between variables using pearson correlation coefficients and point biserial correlation methods, did regression analysis to predict the values and visualize data. All the data was taken from Kaggle and other sites.
